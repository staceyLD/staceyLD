Wow! It took me a bit to add a picture, but I finally figured it out.

<p> Visiting the awesome-public-datasets reposistory brought me to the 
<a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/methods-and-application-of-food-composition-laboratory/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Agriculture's Nutrient Database</a>. As a health conscious citizen, I found the  U.S. Department of Agriculture's Nutrient Database interesting because it provides comprehensive information on the nutrient content of various foods, allowing individuals to make informed choices about their diets and overall health. <br>
Researchers, nutritionists, policmakers, food developers, and educators all benefit from accessing the database as it can support research, dietary planning, product development, tracking and monitoring, education, and policy development related to nutrition and public health. 
Some of the metadata contained in the dataset includes food descriptions, nutrient compositions, standard serving sizes, and information about data sources including published reaserch and laboratory analysis. <br>
The dataset was a bit difficult to to navigate. The link provides access to standalone datasets, but also to the Agriculutral Research Service wich has numerous links to other webpages. A useful featurs is the National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference with provides and interactive interface for users to search for specific foods, view nutrient profiles, and access additional information. However, it was a challenge to find the interface. </p> 

 <p> I went rogue and searched GitHub for topics related to my hobbies. Therefore, the first search was for hiking in NH. Of the four repositories found, I found only one interesting  and that was because of the folder of stunning images of many 4,000 footers in NH. The <a href="https://github.com/DawnSirois/Final-Project-NH4000.github.io" target="_blank">link to that repository can be found here</a>. </p>
<p> The other topic I explored was cooking. This led me to <a href="https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes"target="_blank">TandoorRecipes</a> . When downloaded the application can manage digital collections of recipes and allows importing from other recipe managers. The digital data can then be used to build shopping list, and assist with  meal planning.  </p>
