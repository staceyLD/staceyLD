<p> Visiting the awesome-public-datasets reposistory brought me to the 
<a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/methods-and-application-of-food-composition-laboratory/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Agriculture's Nutrient Database</a>. As a health conscious citizen, I found the  U.S. Department of Agriculture's Nutrient Database interesting because it provides comprehensive information on the nutrient content of various foods, allowing individuals to make informed choices about their diets and overall health. <br>
Researchers, nutritionists, policmakers, food developers, and educators all benefit from accessing the database as it can support research, dietary planning, product development, tracking and monitoring, education, and policy development related to nutrition and public health. 
Some of the metadata contained in the dataset includes food descriptions, nutrient compositions, standard serving sizes, and information about data sources including published reaserch and laboratory analysis. <br>
The dataset was a bit difficult to to navigate. The link provides access to standalone datasets, but also to the Agriculutral Research Service wich has numerous links to other webpages. A useful featurs is the National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference with provides and interactive interface for users to search for specific foods, view nutrient profiles, and access additional information. However, it was a challenge to find the interface. </p>
